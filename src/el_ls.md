# The Language Server

An implementation of the [Language Server Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol) for less than full-blown editors.
This probably won't be necessary on IntelliJ IDEA (which I hope to add support for) or Eclipse IDE, but then again who wants to do all that work?
