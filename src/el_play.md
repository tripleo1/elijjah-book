# The Playground

It is intended that **Elijjah** comes with an advanced playground tool to allow real-time interaction
with programs.

The playground is meant to support exploration of examples of code.

This is meant to be along the lines of XCode's playground, with variable values on the right side of the screen.

## Prototype

Tabs:

- **Code**: Shows code in a simple editor with tabs
- **Libraries**: A graphical `.ez` file editor
- **Wiki**: Enabling documentation
- **Versions**: Integrated Git (not really necessary) and Version Control
- **Runs**: Controlled input (command line, filesystem, environment variables, random seed)
- **Explorer**: A reversible debugger

> This is obviously not implemented yet and will be alot of work.
> It also smells like an IDE.
