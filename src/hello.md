# Hello, World!

```text
class Main {
  main() {
    println("Hello, World!")
  }
}
```

In **Elijjah**, the main class is always called `Main` and must have a function `main` for the entry point.  `println` is just a function in the standard library.

Please note that the main class must be in the unnamed package, and there can only be one per compilation, lest a Compiler Error.
