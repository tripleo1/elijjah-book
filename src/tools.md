# Tools

**Elijah** has a complement of tools to help in programming:

> None of these are implemented yet

* **elget** retrieves source from a local directory, http and hopefully one day ipfs and onet. 
* **eldoc** generates documentation for your source code
* **ellsp** provides a language server to integrate with various editors
* **elplay** is a testing environment intended for use before integration of source code into a project
